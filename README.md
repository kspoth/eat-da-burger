# eat-da-burger

## Project Description

This application allows a user to add the burger of their choice and it will be stored in a database using MySQL. The user will then be able to "add" the burger and it will be moved to the "ready to eat" section. The user can then eat the burger and it will be moved to the "burgers eatten" section. The user can the delete the eatten burger from the list by clicking "throw in trash". The application utilizes Javascript, Handlebars, MySQL, Node JS, CSS and Heroku to allow it to function.
